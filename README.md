# AutoFarm
This is an Android mobile app that gives the user control over the AutoFarm automated watering system. This app allows the user to water the plants at will, it allows the user to enable sensors (The user should enable the sensors when they plant a seed), it allows the user to monitor their system via a camera mounted on the Raspberry Pi, it allows the user to read information regarding their system (moisture level per block and water level) and it allows the user to setup their system to receive low water level alerts via email. The app features a simple Android GUI and it communicates with the system's Raspberry Pi through HTTP requests. Additionally, it uses the Picasso library to retrieve the image from the webserver hosted in the Raspberry Pi as well.
